      In this fast paced world it can be tough to find a medium for donating that is cheap and makes a noticeable difference.
      That is the basis for which Phenominal was founded upon: all donations, no matter how big or small, are important.
      If we as a group of individuals donate, then over time these small sums of money will come together to create great change.
